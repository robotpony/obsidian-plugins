## [Space Command](./space-command)

Focus on the right next task. Simple TODOs and tags in your markdown, surfaced when you need them.

Tag lines with `#todo` and view them in a sidebar or embedded lists. Completing a TODO converts it to `#todone @date`. Supports priority tags (`#focus`, `#p0`-`#p4`, `#future`), project grouping, and an Ideas tab for `#idea` and `#principle` tags.
